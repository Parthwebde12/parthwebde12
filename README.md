Hi, I’m a passionate learner diving deep into the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and building real-world projects to sharpen my development skills. I enjoy creating interactive, user-friendly applications while strengthening my fundamentals in JavaScript, React, and backend development.

💻 Currently, I’m focusing on:

Full-stack development with MERN

Hands-on practice with frontend DOM manipulation

API integration & data handling

Building scalable applications with proper structure

🛠️ Skills:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (Hooks, Components, State Management), DOM Manipulation

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, REST API development

Database: MongoDB (CRUD, Mongoose)

Tools & Concepts: Git & GitHub, JSON, API Integration, Deployment basics (Netlify, Vercel, Render), Problem Solving

📂 Highlighted Projects
1️⃣ My Portfolio Website – Showcasing my skills, learning journey, and projects in one place.
2️⃣ 3 Small DOM Projects – Mini projects to practice JavaScript, events, and dynamic UI changes.
3️⃣ Employee Management App – A CRUD-based project to manage employee records efficiently.
4️⃣ Movie Search App (API-based) – Fetching and displaying movie data from an external API.
5️⃣ Jobs Portal Project – A larger-scale project simulating a job listing and hiring platform.
6️⃣ Several MERN Projects – Building and experimenting with different aspects of the MERN stack to gain practical, end-to-end experience.
